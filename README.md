# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This project focuses on creating a back-end for the WTWR project. Here we use express.js and the mongoose framework to create a server. Inside the server the user is able to Create Read Update Delete data from the database with a custom made API. The API uses current standards and practices for handling errors.

## Technologies
JavaScript
  Express.js

MongoDb
  mongoose

EsLint

Git

## Techniques
Express.js is the main back-end framework used to handle all the server-side routing and logic.

We use MongoDb as the database to store all the user data.

The user can create new items thanks to Mongoose, which is an Object modeling tool framework of Node.js.

We use a linter like EsLint to catch any last minute bugs before commiting.

Through the Bash terminal, we push commits to github for version control.
